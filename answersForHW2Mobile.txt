5. To run existing tests on real device in my project:
	1. Open src/main/java/setup/testNativeData.properties (or testWebData.properties if you testing web app)
	2. Find property "device"
	3. set "device=realDeviceName" (for ex. device=HT7281202375) if you want to work with real device (device=emulator-xxxx for emulator)
6. There is not big difference between working with emulator and working with real device.
To work with real device:
	1. Activate Developer mode on real device and debug USB connection (on emulator we should just run emulator)
	2. Open Appium Desktop (similar for emulator)
	3. Run server (run locally: 0.0.0.0:4723) (similar for emulator)
	4. Click button with "Magnifire" image to start an Inspector session (similar for emulator)
	5. Create desired capabilities using "deviceName":"realDeviceName" (for emulator "deviceName":"emulator-xxxx")
	6. Click "Start Session" (similar for emulator)
	7. Open project with test in Intellij-Idea (similar for emulator)
	8. Dont't forget to make changes which are described in answer for question 5 (not required for emulator)
	9. Run required tests
